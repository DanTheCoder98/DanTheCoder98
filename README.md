## 👦🏼 About Me

My coding journey began at 17 when I wasn’t quite sure which career path to take. I landed my first job by dropping my CV at local businesses, which led to a position in a recruitment agency. Over time, I rotated through various departments—marketing, finance, payroll, resources, health & safety, operations—until I found myself in the IT department. That’s where my curiosity and passion for tech began to bloom.

Working with the hardware team sparked my interest, and when a position opened up in the development team, I decided to give it a shot. From the moment I wrote my first “Hello, World!” program, I was hooked. Coding became my passion, and it motivated me to pursue a degree in Computer Science.
