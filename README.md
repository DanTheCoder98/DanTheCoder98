# üëãüèª Hi there!

## About Me

My coding journey began at 17 when I wasn‚Äôt quite sure which career path to take. I landed my first job by dropping my CV at local businesses, which led to a position in a recruitment agency. Over time, I rotated through various departments‚Äîmarketing, finance, payroll, resources, health & safety, operations‚Äîuntil I found myself in the IT department. That‚Äôs where my curiosity and passion for tech began to bloom.

Working with the hardware team sparked my interest, and when a position opened up in the development team, I decided to give it a shot. From the moment I wrote my first ‚ÄúHello, World!‚Äù program, I was hooked. Coding became my passion, and it motivated me to pursue a degree in Computer Science.
